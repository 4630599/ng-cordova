# Ionic 2 Starter

This is a simple Ionic 2 starter project.

To get started run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
```bash
$ npm install
```

Then use either `gulp watch.systemjs` or `gulp watch.webpack` to transpile the app's es6 code down to es5, spin up a local development server and watch for changes.  Both SystemJS and Webpack builds have their pros and cons, but both work outside of the box with incremental compilation for this starter.  For more information on both, check out their docs: https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs and http://webpack.github.io/.

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8100` to check it out!
