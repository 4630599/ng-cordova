## Overview

[ngCordova](http://ngCordova.com) was built to help make app development faster and more efficient than ever before.
It gives you simple [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) wrappers for the most popular [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) plugins available,
where you can take a picture, scan a barcode, upload a file, turn on your flashlight, get your current location, and much more with just a few lines of code.
